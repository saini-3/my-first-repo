I learned that GitHub is a powerful platform used for version control and collaboration in software development. It uses Git to track changes in code, making it easier to manage projects and work with others. I discovered how to create repositories to store code, use commits to save changes, and create branches to experiment without affecting the main project. I also learned how to collaborate through pull requests and how issues can be used to track bugs or suggest improvements. Overall, GitHub helps teams stay organized and efficient while working on coding projects.
